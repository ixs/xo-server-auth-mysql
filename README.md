# xo-server-auth-mysql

> MySQL authentication plugin for XO-Server

This plugin allows MySQL users to authenticate to Xen-Orchestra.

The first time a user signs in, XO will create a new XO user with the
same identifier.

## Install

Installation of the npm package:

```
> npm install --global xo-server-auth-mysql
```

## Usage

Like all other xo-server plugins, it can be configured directly via
the web interface, see [the plugin documentation](https://xen-orchestra.com/docs/plugins.html).

If you have issues, you can use the provided CLI to gather more
information:

```
> xo-server-auth-mysql
? hostname database.example.com
? credentials > username ro_query
? fill optional credentials > password? Yes
? credentials > password ********
? database users
? query SELECT Account AS username, DESPasswort AS password, ACLs AS permission FROM Users AS U WHERE A.Account = ?
? crypto_schema DES
? fill optional insecureAuth? Yes

configuration saved in ./mysql.cache.conf
